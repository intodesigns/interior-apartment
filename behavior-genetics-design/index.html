<p>Behavioral genetic methodologies from twin and adoption studies through DNA analysis will be described and applied to address longstanding questions about the origins of individual differences in behavioral traits. Human behavioural geneticists use several designs to answer questions about the nature and mechanisms of genetic influences on behavior. In a child-based design the children are twins or siblings and the focus is on how genetic influences of the children influence how they are treated by their parents. Behavior genetics the study of the influence of an organisms genetic composition on its behavior and the interaction of heredity and environment insofar as they affect behavior. Charles Darwin who originated the theory that natural selection is the basis of biological evolution was persuaded by Francis Galton that the principles of natural selection applied to behavior as well as physical characteristics.

<p>The idea that better understanding of the human experience promotes better design appears to be gaining tractionparticularly now with software that reveals our subliminal visual experience and how it directs our behavior in and around buildings. Twin studies of genetic influences on parenting take two approaches. Human behavior genetic research focuses on studying naturally occurring genetic and environmental variation and utilizes data from different types of genetically related individuals. In a child-based design the children are twins or siblings and the focus is on how genetic influences of the children influence how they are treated by their parents.
