<p>In many cases drugs that have traditionally been prescribed four times a day have been found to work just as well when larger doses are taken twice. If you forget to take a dose of your antibiotics take that dose as soon as you remember and then continue to take your course of antibiotics as normal. No one expects four times a day to mean literally every 6 hours on the minute. But if its almost time for the next dose skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. For oral antibiotics 3 times a day usually means about 7 to 8 hours apart.
