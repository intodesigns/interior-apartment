The negation of an apartness relation is an equivalence relation. In classical mathematics they tend to be equivalent to better-known definitions expressed in terms of closeness rather than apartness. Starting from the point-subset apartness axiomatised in previous papers we characterise the constructive meaning of two subsets of a given set lie apart from each other. For example the relation x - y is a unit on a local ring is an apartness relation.

<p>In constructive mathematics an apartness relation is a constructive form of inequality and is often taken to be more basic than equality. For this reason in constructive topology especially the apartness relation over a set is often taken as primitive and equality is a defined relation. A relation ρ is a coequality relation if it is consistent symmetric and co-transitive. For a coequality relation ρ on a set X with apartness we analyze the family CopX of. Apartness relation says.
